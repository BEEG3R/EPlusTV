# EPlusTV

Current version: **0.9.0**

## About
This takes ESPN+ and transforms it into a "live TV" experience. It will discover what is on, create a schedule of channels and give you an m3u and xmltv file that you can import into things like Jellyfin, Channels DVR, or just maybe Jellyfin through Channels DVR!

## Using
The server exposes 2 main endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| /channels.m3u | The channel list you'll import into your client |
| /xmltv.xml | The schedule that you'll import into your client |

## Running
The recommended way of running is to pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m0ngr31/eplustv).

### Docker Setup

#### Environement Variables
| Environment Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| ACCESS_URI | What accessable URL your clients will be connecting from. For example: `http://192.168.0.1:8000` |
| ESPN_USER | Your ESPN+ Username |
| ESPN_PASS | Your ESPN+ Password |
| START_CHANNEL | What the first channel number should be. Keep in mind this generates 100 channels to keep a healthy buffer. |


#### Volumes
| Volume Name | Description |
|---|---|
| /app/config | Used to store DB and application state. |
| /app/tmp | Used to store temporary segments generated by the streams. Recommended to use something like `/dev/shm`. |


#### Docker Run
By default, the easiest way to get running is:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /config_dir:/app/config -v /dev/shm:/app/tmp -e ACCESS_URI='http://192.168.0.10:8000' -e ESPN_USER='...' -e ESPN_PASS='...'  m0ngr31/eplustv
